CIFAR-10 - Object Recognition in Images
CIFAR-10  is an established computer-vision dataset used for object recognition. It is a subset of the 80 million tiny images dataset and consists of 60,000 32x32 color images containing one of 10 object classes, with 6000 images per class. It was collected by Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton

The CIFAR-10 data consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images in the official data.

The label classes in the dataset are:

1. airplane 
2. automobile 
3. bird 
4. cat 
5. deer 
6. dog 
7. frog 
8. horse 
9. ship 
10. truck

<b>Deep Learning Problem:</b> <br>
1. Detect and recognise the objects/images from the data set with optimum accuracy.
2. Accuracy should be considerably higher.
3. There is no time constraint.

<b>Steps followed to solve the problem:</b><br>
1. Load and pre-process the data
2. Define the modelâ€™s architecture
3. Train the model
4. Make predictions <br>
